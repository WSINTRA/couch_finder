Build a command line app that asks a customer for there name.
*Welcome to The Coach finder Â©, please enter your name to begin:*
>Will

#Couch finder then stores customer name in an array with name as key and #name as value. If the name already exists the Couch finder should do something else. See below past basic operation.

*Thank you Will, please tell me your budget so I 
can get an idea of your price range, you can just enter a number like 500 or 1000:
*
#Couch finder then adds budget with key value pairs to the hash.

*Okay thats great, just one more thing before we return your resuts, what is your maximum size required in feet, you can just enter a number like 5 or 6:
*
#Couch finder then returns a list of couch suppliers based on the budget and size requirements.

#That is the basic operation..

What I want to add is the functionality so that a customer can then order the couch. This would then update the database to show that the supplier quantity has gone down and the customers remaining budget shows it has reduced. A record will be made that a couch has been sold to a customer. When a customer sells their couch they can remove themselves from the db.


TODO. Work on command prompt to give users more options on open, in case of returning customer.
Smooth out return values so the data is presented in a user friendly manner and a list of suppliers is presented to the customer.

TODO. Work on order processing, once a user has decided on what they want to order they can create a new order for the desired order number from their scan.
