# Couch Finder app

##Getting started

1. In order to run the app make sure you are in the root directory.
2. run $: bundle install
2. run $: ruby bin/run.rb
3. The app will present you with a list of possible commands.

Overview.
The app is designed to take a new user and return a list of available products and suppliers of those products.
Once a new user is created that info is stored in the database and is accesible through one of the cli menu's.
Previous users can update current requirements and scan again based on any new requirements.
Once a scan has been made users are shown different possible order numbers.
Orders can be placed using the order numbers.
Once an order has been placed a returning user can check an order.
Users are also able to delete an existing account if they no longer wish to be on the system.

Disclaimer.
This app was created to demonstrate useage of CRUD within database relationships and not as an actual couch finder any names, prices, suppliers or couches used are entirely fictional for the purpose of the exercise.
